      <h1 class="detailTitle">Kant’s Moral Philosophy</h1>
      <p class="detailMeta">Johnson, Robert, and Adam Cureton. “Kant’s Moral Philosophy.” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, 2 Oct. 2025, plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/.</p>

        This source provides a detailed overview of Kant’s moral philosophy, including the Categorical Imperative, duties of right and virtue, and how moral principles relate to human autonomy, rationality, and dignity. Kant emphasizes treating people as free, valuable individuals who can make their own choices, and he argues that we should act according to maxims that can be universalized. He also differentiates between strict moral duties, such as not stealing or lying, and more flexible duties, like helping others, which allow some personal judgement in our actions. While Kant doesn’t directly discuss dark humor, his ideas can help us consider when it might be morally permissible. For example, a joke that treats someone as an object for laughter would go against Kantian ethics because it disrespects their autonomy and dignity. However, humor that doesn’t harm anyone directly or treats everyone fairly could align with Kant’s principles since it follows a maxim that could potentially be universalized. This source is valuable because it shows that morality isn’t only about outcomes, but also about the intentions behind actions and whether they respect the freedom and value of others. Applying this to dark humor could help us explore the conditions under which it could be acceptable: when it doesn’t exploit or demean others and could be viewed as ethical in a broader sense.
