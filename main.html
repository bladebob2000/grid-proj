      <h2>John Stuart Mill — Utilitarianism</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Mill, John Stuart. <em>Utilitarianism.</em> 1863. Utilitarianism.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <em>Utilitarianism</em>, John Stuart Mill argues that morality should be judged
        by the consequences of actions, especially how much happiness or unhappiness
        they produce. This framework evaluates dark humor by focusing on its effects
        rather than surface offensiveness. From Mill’s perspective, dark humor may be
        morally acceptable if it creates more amusement, relief, or connection than
        harm. However, when it clearly causes suffering or reduces overall well-being,
        it becomes morally problematic. This source is useful because it offers a
        practical way to weigh the social costs and benefits of dark humor.

      <h2>Robert Johnson & Adam Cureton — Kant’s Moral Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Johnson, Robert, and Adam Cureton. “Kant’s Moral Philosophy.” 
        <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        This source outlines Kant’s moral philosophy, emphasizing autonomy, dignity,
        and acting according to universal moral principles. Kant’s framework helps
        assess dark humor by examining whether it treats individuals as ends rather
        than means. Humor that objectifies or dehumanizes others violates Kantian
        ethics, while humor that respects autonomy could be morally permissible.
        This source is valuable because it highlights that morality depends not only
        on outcomes, but also on intention and respect.

      <h2>James Rachels — Subjectivism in Ethics</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Rachels, James. “Subjectivism in Ethics.” Purdue University, 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachels explains Ethical Subjectivism, the view that moral judgments are based
        on personal feelings rather than objective facts. Applied to dark humor, this
        suggests jokes are morally acceptable depending on individual reactions.
        However, Rachels critiques this theory by showing its inability to explain real
        moral disagreement or justify moral reasoning. This source is useful because
        it reveals both the appeal and limitations of judging dark humor purely through
        personal response.

      <h2>Brigaud & Blanc — Dark Humor and Moral Judgment</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Brigaud, Emmanuelle, and Nathalie Blanc. “When Dark Humor and Moral Judgment Meet
        in Sacrificial Dilemmas.” National Library of Medicine, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        This study shows that exposure to dark humor can reduce emotional resistance
        to harm in moral dilemmas, making utilitarian choices more likely. Dark humor
        weakens emotional responses by presenting serious violations in a playful way.
        While this can help with coping, it also raises ethical concerns when humor
        encourages harmful attitudes. This source is important because it provides
        psychological evidence for both the benefits and dangers of dark humor.

      <h2>Rebekah Bills — In Defense of Dark Humor</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Bills, Rebekah. “In Defense of Dark Humor.” <em>Providence</em>, 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bills argues that dark humor can help individuals cope with morally disturbing
        situations by making harsh realities manageable. Drawing on personal experience
        and historical examples, the article shows how dark humor exposes uncomfortable
        truths without trivializing them. This source is useful because it emphasizes
        dark humor’s role in resilience, awareness, and moral reflection.
