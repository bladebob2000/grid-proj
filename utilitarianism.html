      <p>
        In Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill explains that morality should be based on the consequences of actions, especially by how much happiness or unhappiness they create. Mill argues that people often disagree about what is “right” or “wrong,” but many of our moral beliefs are actually influenced by the idea that good actions should increase overall happiness. This idea can help us evaluate dark humor because it focuses on how jokes affect people rather than whether they seem offensive on the surface. From Mill’s perspective, dark humor could be morally acceptable if it brings more amusement, relief, or connection to people than the amount of harm or discomfort it causes. His point that moral rules only make sense when they support overall well-being also suggests that dark humor can become a problem when it clearly hurts others or reduces their happiness. This source is useful because it offers a way to judge dark humor by weighing out its positive and negative effects on society, instead of treating it as automatically right or wrong.
