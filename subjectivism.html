        In Subjectivism in Ethics, James Rachels explains Ethical Subjectivism, or the idea that moral judgements are based on personal feelings rather than objective facts. Rachels shows how people often disagree strongly about moral issues, such as homosexuality, and uses this to argue that subjectivists believe these disagreements are really just differences in attitude. This theory suggests that calling something “wrong” doesn’t describe a real moral quality in the world, but it just reflects how an individual feels about it themselves. When applied to dark humor, Ethical Subjectivism would say that a joke is only moral or not depending on how someone personally reacts to it. This means dark humor could be morally permissible for some people if they feel that it’s fine, even if others disapprove of it or feel negative about it. However, Rachels also points out weaknesses in subjectivism, such as its inability to explain real moral disagreement and why moral judgements need reasoning. These criticisms suggest that relying only on personal feelings isn’t enough to decide whether dark humor is acceptable, especially when it affects others. Overall, this source is useful because it shows how personal reactions shape moral judgement and it highlights the limitations of using only feelings to decide if dark humor is morally permissible.
