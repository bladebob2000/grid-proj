        In this article, the author reflects on personal experiences working in intelligence to argue that dark humor can help people cope with disturbing or morally difficult situations. The author describes here a dark joke about terrorists’ crimes and finding it both devastating and funny, showing how humor allowed people to confront horrifying situations without becoming emotionally desensitized. Historical examples, such as Aristotle, Erasmus, Shakespeare, Churchill, and Lincoln, show that humor has been used for a long time to expose human flaws and moral failures while making hard truths more bearable. The article explains that dark humor doesn't fully make light of bad situations, but rather highlights it in a wat that is unsettling, yet manageable. This can help people maintain perspective, morale, and emotional resilience at the same time. This source is helpful for exploring our question because it highlights the moral and psychological value of dark humor: it can uncover hidden truths, provide relief, and cause unity, showing that making dark jokes can be morally permissible when it encourages awareness and coping instead of harm.
