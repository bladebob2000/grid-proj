          Utilitarianism judges morality entirely by consequences, specifically focusing on the balance of happiness over suffering. John Stuart Mill argues that while people disagree on what is fundamentally "right," many moral beliefs are ultimately influenced by the idea that good actions should increase overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applying this framework, dark humor can be morally acceptable when it successfully creates more amusement, relief, or social connection than the harm or discomfort it causes. This perspective evaluates dark humor by its real-world, measurable effects rather than its surface offensiveness. Conversely, dark humor becomes morally impermissible when it clearly hurts individuals or reduces their overall happiness, aligning with Mill’s point that moral rules only make sense when they support the collective good. This source offers a way to judge dark humor by weighing its total positive and negative societal impacts.

        <h2>Kantian Ethics — Dignity & Respect</h2>

          Kantian ethics, built on the Categorical Imperative, emphasizes human autonomy, rationality, and dignity. Actions are moral only if they treat individuals as ends in themselves rather than merely as objects or tools (means). Kant differentiates between strict duties (like not lying) and flexible duties (like helping others) but maintains that morality is centered on the intention behind the action and universal respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          For dark humor, this means any joke that dehumanizes, exploits, or treats a victim as an object for laughter would fundamentally violate Kant’s principles, disrespecting their autonomy and inherent value. However, humor that respects the individual, doesn't cause direct harm, and follows a maxim (rule) that could be universalized without contradiction may be deemed morally permissible. This framework reveals that morality is not solely about outcomes, but about ensuring that all actions respect the freedom and value of others.

        <h2>Ethical Subjectivism — James Rachels</h2>

        <p>
          Ethical Subjectivism holds that moral judgments reflect personal feelings and attitudes rather than objective facts. James Rachels explains that when people disagree strongly on moral issues, subjectivists believe these are merely differences in personal attitudes. Applied to dark humor, this suggests a joke is morally acceptable if and only if the individual feels comfortable with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, dark humor could be morally permissible for some people because they personally feel it is fine, even if others strongly disapprove. However, Rachels critiques this theory by showing its weaknesses, such as its inability to explain genuine moral disagreement or justify why moral judgments require reasoning. These limitations highlight that relying purely on subjective feelings is insufficient for determining whether dark humor is ethically acceptable, especially when it affects others.

          <p>Finding: Dark humor reduces emotional resistance to difficult moral choices.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          Psychological research by Brigaud and Blanc investigates how dark humor influences moral decisions, particularly in sacrificial dilemmas like the trolley problem. Their findings suggest that exposure to dark humor can make individuals slightly more willing to choose the utilitarian option (harnessing one to save many).
        </p>
        <p>
          The authors explain that humor's effectiveness lies in reducing the strong emotional resistance people normally feel toward morally difficult actions, making the violation feel less severe—or even "benign". This shows that while dark humor can help individuals cope with emotional pressure, it raises serious ethical concerns when it dulls moral sensitivity. The research suggests that dark humor carries moral risk when it normalizes harm or encourages harmful attitudes, especially when the person joking benefits from the negative outcomes. Its permissibility rests on whether it impedes a person's sense of right versus wrong.

        <h2>In Defense of Dark Humor</h2>

          Bills, Rebekah. <em>Providence.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          Drawing on experiences in morally complex and disturbing fields like intelligence, Rebekah Bills argues that dark humor functions as a vital coping mechanism. Rather than trivializing suffering, dark humor can help individuals confront harsh realities, such as terrorist crimes, without emotional collapse or becoming desensitized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, figures from Aristotle to Churchill have used humor to expose human flaws and moral failures while making difficult truths more bearable. Dark humor doesn't fully make light of bad situations; instead, it highlights the disturbing nature in an unsettling yet manageable way, helping people maintain perspective, morale, and emotional resilience. When used to foster awareness, resilience, or solidarity, dark humor may be morally permissible—and even valuable—as it uncovers hidden truths, provides collective relief, and causes unity instead of harm.
