      <h2>Utilitarianism — John Stuart Mill</h2>

        Mill, John Stuart. <em>Utilitarianism.</em> 1863.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a utilitarian perspective, morality depends on consequences,
        specifically how much happiness or suffering an action produces.
        Dark humor can be morally acceptable if it creates more amusement,
        relief, or connection than harm. However, when jokes cause clear
        emotional pain or reduce overall well-being, they become morally
        wrong. This framework judges dark humor by its real-world effects,
        not by whether it appears offensive at first glance.

      <h2>Kantian Ethics — Dignity & Respect</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Johnson, Robert, and Adam Cureton. <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Kantian ethics focuses on respect for autonomy and human dignity.
        Actions are moral only if they treat people as ends in themselves,
        not as objects or tools. Dark humor that dehumanizes or exploits
        others for laughter would be morally impermissible. However, humor
        that does not demean individuals and could be universalized may
        align with Kant’s moral principles.

      <h2>Ethical Subjectivism — James Rachels</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Rachels, James. “Subjectivism in Ethics.” Purdue University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical Subjectivism claims that moral judgments are expressions of
        personal feelings rather than objective facts. Applied to dark
        humor, this means a joke is morally acceptable if the individual
        finds it acceptable. However, Rachels criticizes this view by
        showing that it cannot explain genuine moral disagreement or
        provide reasons for moral criticism. This highlights the limits
        of judging dark humor solely by personal reaction.

      <h2>Psychology — Dark Humor & Moral Judgment</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Brigaud, Emmanuelle, and Nathalie Blanc. National Library of Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychological research shows that dark humor can reduce emotional
        resistance to morally difficult actions by making violations feel
        less serious. While this can help people cope with stress, it also
        raises ethical concerns when humor encourages harmful attitudes.
        This evidence suggests that dark humor is morally risky when it
        dulls moral sensitivity.

      <h2>In Defense of Dark Humor</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Bills, Rebekah. <em>Providence.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dark humor can serve as a coping mechanism in disturbing or morally
        challenging situations. Rather than trivializing suffering, it can
        help people confront harsh realities without emotional collapse.
        When used to foster awareness, resilience, or solidarity, dark
        humor may be morally permissible and even valuable.
