      <p>
        Utilitarianism judges morality by consequences, specifically the balance
        of happiness over suffering. From this perspective, dark humor can be
        morally acceptable when it creates more amusement, relief, or social
        connection than harm. However, when jokes produce emotional pain or reduce
        overall well-being, they become morally impermissible. This framework
        evaluates dark humor by its real-world effects rather than surface
        offensiveness.

      <h2>Kantian Ethics — Dignity & Respect</h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Kantian ethics emphasizes autonomy and human dignity. Actions are moral
        only if they treat individuals as ends in themselves rather than as
        objects or tools. Dark humor that dehumanizes or exploits others for
        laughter would violate Kant’s principles. Humor that respects autonomy
        and could be universalized may be morally permissible.

      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical Subjectivism holds that moral judgments reflect personal feelings
        rather than objective facts. Applied to dark humor, this suggests that a
        joke is morally acceptable if an individual feels comfortable with it.
        However, Rachels critiques this theory by showing that it cannot explain
        genuine moral disagreement or justify moral reasoning, revealing the
        limits of purely subjective evaluation.

      <h2>Psychology — Dark Humor & Moral Judgment</h2>
      <p class="citation">
        Brigaud, Emmanuelle, and Nathalie Blanc. National Library of Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psychological research suggests that dark humor can reduce emotional
        resistance to morally difficult actions by making violations feel less
        severe. While this can help individuals cope with stress, it also raises
        ethical concerns when humor dulls moral sensitivity. These findings
        suggest that dark humor carries moral risk when it normalizes harm.

      <h2>In Defense of Dark Humor</h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Dark humor can function as a coping mechanism in disturbing or morally
        complex situations. Rather than trivializing suffering, it can help
        individuals confront harsh realities without emotional collapse. When
        used to foster awareness, resilience, or solidarity, dark humor may be
        morally permissible and even valuable.
