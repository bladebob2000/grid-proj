        <h2>Utilitarianism</h2>
        <p class="citation">Based on Mill, John Stuart. <em>Utilitarianism.</em> 1863.</p>
        
        <p>
          John Stuart Mill’s philosophy asks us to do a simple calculation: does the action increase overall happiness or suffering? In this light, a dark joke isn't judged by how "offensive" it sounds, but by its actual impact. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If a joke brings relief to a grieving group or bonds people together, the "utility" (happiness) might outweigh the momentary shock. However, the moment a joke causes genuine emotional damage or reduces the well-being of the target, it crosses the line into immorality. For a Utilitarian, the permissibility of dark humor is a numbers game: <strong>Does the laughter outweigh the pain?</strong>

        <h2>Kantian Ethics</h2>
        <p class="citation">Based on Johnson, Robert, and Adam Cureton. <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</em></p>
        
        <p>
          Immanuel Kant doesn't care if people laughed. He cares about <em>dignity</em>. His Categorical Imperative dictates that we must never treat people merely as tools for our own amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a stricter test for dark humor. A joke that "uses" a victim’s tragedy just to get a laugh creates a moral violation because it strips the subject of their autonomy. However, Kantian ethics allows for nuance: if the humor respects the humanity of the subject—perhaps by mocking the oppressor rather than the oppressed—it may be universalized as a form of truth-telling rather than exploitation.

        <span class="tag">Personal Feeling</span>
        <h2>Ethical Subjectivism</h2>
        <p class="citation">Based on Rachels, James. “Subjectivism in Ethics.” Purdue University.</p>
        
        <p>
          Is morality just a matter of taste? Ethical Subjectivism argues that when we say "that joke is wrong," we are really just saying "I don't like that joke". 
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this framework, dark humor is morally permissible whenever the listener <em>feels</em> it is. There is no objective "line" to cross. However, James Rachels warns that this viewpoint is limited; it fails to explain why we can have productive arguments about what is right and wrong. If humor is purely subjective, we lose the ability to critique jokes that perpetuate real societal harm.

        <h2>Psychological Impact</h2>
        <p class="citation">Based on Brigaud, Emmanuelle, and Nathalie Blanc. National Library of Medicine.</p>
        
        <div class="callout-box">
          <strong>Key Finding:</strong> Dark humor can make moral violations feel "benign."
        </div>

        <p>
          Science complicates the picture. Research shows that dark humor functions as a buffer, lowering our emotional resistance to difficult situations. In studies involving the "trolley problem," exposure to dark humor actually made people more willing to sacrifice one life to save many.
        </p>
        <p>
          This creates a paradox: dark humor helps us cope with stress, but it risks dulling our moral sensitivity. It is permissible as a coping mechanism, but dangerous if it desensitizes us to genuine violence.

        <h2>In Defense of Dark Humor</h2>
        <p class="citation">Based on Bills, Rebekah. <em>Providence.</em></p>
        
        <p>
          Those who work in the darkest fields—intelligence, emergency medicine, war—often rely on humor to survive. Rebekah Bills argues that dark humor allows people to stare at the abyss without breaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, from Shakespeare to Churchill, humor has been used to expose difficult truths. It doesn't necessarily trivialize suffering; it makes the suffering manageable. In this view, dark humor is not just permissible, but <strong>necessary</strong> for resilience in a tragic world.

        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>
          Is dark humor morally permissible? The answer lies in the <strong>intent</strong> and the <strong>impact</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While <strong>Kant</strong> warns us against using others for entertainment, and <strong>Psychology</strong> warns of desensitization, <strong>Utilitarianism</strong> and the <strong>Defense</strong> argument reveal that dark humor is a vital tool for human resilience. It becomes immoral when it punches down or dulls our empathy. But when used to cope, connect, or expose truth, it remains a fundamental—if sharp—part of the human experience.
