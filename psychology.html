      <h1 class="detailTitle">When Dark Humor and Moral Judgment Meet</h1>
      <p class="detailMeta">Brigaud, Emmanuelle, and Nathalie Blanc. “When Dark Humor and Moral Judgment Meet in Sacrificial Dilemmas: Preliminary Evidence With Females.” National Library of Medicine, 30 Nov. 2021, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8768463/.</p>

      <p>
        In this article, Brigaud and Blanc study how dark humor influences people’s moral decisions, especially in situations where harming one person could save many others. The authors tested female college students by giving them either dark jokes or harmless jokes before asking them to judge classic dilemmas like the trolley problem. Their results show that dark humor makes people slightly more willing to choose the utilitarian option (killing one person to save several others), especially when the decision would also benefit themselves. The authors explain that humor can weaken the strong emotional reaction people normally feel toward harming someone, which makes the action seem less serious. Dark humor does this more strongly because it treats disturbing topics in a light, playful way, which makes the violation feel “benign.” This source is helpful is helpful for exploring our question because it shows both the benefits and risks of using dark jokes. On one hand, dark humor can help people cope with stressful situations by reducing the emotional pressure caused by them. On the other hand, it can make serious things feel too acceptable in cases where the person joking benefits from it. Because of this, the article suggests that dark humor is only morally permissible when it doesn’t encourage harmful attitudes or impede people’s senses of right versus wrong.
